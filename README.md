### The Swami Company

### What

An open-source, cross-platform workout tracking app built with Remix, React, and TypeScript.

### Why

Current-gen workout tracking apps are either too expensive, too complicated, or too limited. I wanted to build a workout tracking app that was simple, easy to use, and free.

### Where

(Coming soon)
